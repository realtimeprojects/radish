## What is `radish` ?
`radish` is a "Behavior-Driven Developement"-Tool written in python.<br />
It is inspired by other `BDD`-Tools like `cucumber` or `lettuce`.<br />

## Installation
There are several ways to install `radish` on your computer:

### Simple installation with pip
This is probably the simplest way to install `radish`.<br />
Since the `radish` releases are hostet as well on [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) you can use the following command to install `radish`:

    pip install radish

*Note: On some systems you have to be root to install a package over pip.*

### Manual installation from source
If you always want to be up to date with the newest commits you may want to install `radish` directly from [source code](https://github.com/timofurrer/radish).<br />
Use the following command sequence to clone the repository from github and install `radish` afterwards:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/timofurrer/radish.git ~/radish
cd ~/radish
git submodule init
git submodule update
python setup.py install
```

*Note: On some systems you have to be root to install a package over setuptools.*

#### Update source installation
If you have once installation `radish` from source you might want to update it from time to time.<br />
Change into the directory where you have cloned `radish` into (default: `~/radish`) and pull the newest commit from github. When you've done this you need to re-install `radish` again.<br />
So, in summary:

```bash
cd ~/radish
git pull
python setup.py install
```

*Note: On some systems you have to be root to install a package over setuptools.*
